    ... required by package `trips-service v0.1.0 (/home/puujee/trips/rust-service)`
versions that meet the requirements `^2` are: 2.15.0, 2.14.0, 2.13.0, 2.12.0, 2.11.0, 2.10.0, 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.8.0, 2.7.0, 2.6.1, 2.6.0, 2.5.0, 2.4.0, 2.3.0, 2.2.0, 2.1.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.0

package `trips-service` depends on `bson` with feature `serde_helpers` but `bson` does not have that feature.


all possible versions conflict with previously selected packages.

  previously selected package `bson v2.8.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `bson = "^2"` of package `trips-service v0.1.0 (/home/puujee/trips/rust-service)`

failed to select a version for `bson` which could resolve this conflict
